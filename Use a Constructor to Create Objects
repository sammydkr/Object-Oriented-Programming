Here's the Bird constructor from the previous challenge:

function Bird() {
  this.name = "Albert";
  this.color  = "blue";
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let blueBird = new Bird();

Or hound constructor 

function Dog() {
  this.name = "Rupert";
  this.color = "brown";
  this.numLegs = 4;
}
let hound = new Dog ()
