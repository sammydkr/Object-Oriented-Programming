the describe method is shared by Bird and Dog:

Bird.prototype = {
  constructor: Bird,
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};

Dog.prototype = {
  constructor: Dog,
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};


function Animal() { };

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal, 
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};

Since Animal includes the describe method, you can remove it from Bird and Dog:

Bird.prototype = {
  constructor: Bird
};

Dog.prototype = {
  constructor: Dog
};


The eat method is repeated in both Cat and Bear. Edit the code in the spirit of DRY by moving the eat method to the Animal supertype.


Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal,
  eat: function() {
  console.log("nom nom nom");
  }
};
